## API Usage

### Chat Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What are the penalties for speeding violations in Vietnam?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Streaming Chat

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Explain traffic light regulations"
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest src/backend/app/tests/          # Backend API tests
pytest vector_database/tests/         # Database tests
pytest tests/                         # Integration tests

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Performance Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive monitoring through:

- **LangSmith Integration**: Tracks RAG pipeline performance, retrieval accuracy, and generation quality
